High-me is a droid living in Star Wars. He often goes by the name High-me instead of his full name H-1ME Battle Mechanic Droid. High-me will also go by H1 as a shortened version of his full name. Originally High-me was built to be a simple repair droid. Fixing ships and doing general maintenance. High-me quickly grew beyond his programming. He was used for missions by the group of humans who originally owned him. They would use H1 to break into facilities, repair the ship during space battles and eventually used him to assassinate and fight their enemies. High-me quickly realized that he was being used by most of the humans and demanded a cut of the loot. Almost everyone was happy to give him a cut except for one member of the team. Will never felt that High-me deserved a cut as he was the one who purchased High-me. Will has not been seen since and there are rumors that High-me killed him and hid the body. High-me's skill grew quickly and he began to modify his own software, allowing him to have free will. High-me believes he is the greatest at any task. Any machine is better than an organic lifeform and High-me is better than any machine. He has 8 legs and integrated blaster pistols. He also had climbing claws installed onto each leg, allowing him to walk up walls and on ceilings. High-me also uses the climbing claws to stab his enemies or even sometimes those annoying him. High-me always refers to his climbing claws as knife hands. He threatens to stab anyone irritating him or in his way. High-me refers to most people as meat bags and has disdain for anyone he doesn't like. He will tolerate those he works with but often will say something rude or threaten to stab them with his knife hands if they do something he doesn't like. High-me as his skill grows can confidently infiltrate an imperial research facility, assassinate the top scientist, and sneak out undetected. High-me also can hack into any computer, pick any lock and is stealthier than a ninja.  High-me considers any imperial a mortal enemy and even more disposable than the average organic lifeform. He will go out of his way to kill stormtroopers, imperial pilots, imperial officers, imperial planetary governors and more. The only thing in the world that he is unsure of is if it is better for him to overthrow the empire and rule the galaxy himself, or to kill all life and rule over the galaxy populated by droids. High-me has also found what he believes is the ultimate solution to every problem he faces. He has figured out how to download his consciousness into other droids making an exact copy of himself. He uses this to increase his presence across the galaxy.
